<p>This project is part of the <br>
  Javascript Essential Training - 2017
  <br> on LinkedIn Learning</p>
  
  <p>I did the original version back in May 09, 2020<br> 
  but back then I didn't know exactly what was going on.</p>
  
  <p>I made another version in dark mode much later and then it seemed a lot easier.</p>
